In this project Artificial Intelligence (CS561), we have dealt with the task of writer recognition of online handwriting captured from a writing board. A set of features were extracted from this data which was used to train a text and language independent on-line writer identification system. We describe here two systems; firstly Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) which provide a powerful yet simple means of representing the distribution of the features extracted from the handwritten text. The second system is based on k-means clustering process. Different sets of features are described and metrics are evaluated in this report. The system is tested using text from a set of around 50 different writers. The GMM model provided us with better identification accuracy as compared to the k-means clustering approach for the same problem.
